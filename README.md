# Assignment 5 â€“ Recurrences and Hash Tables

**Deadline:** Wednesday, March 19, 2025, 9:59 pm

## Objectives:
- Understand and get familiar with the hash table data structure, along with its application in managing user accounts.

## Instructions:
- For problems marked as (code), write a Java program that will be run by the instructor.
- For problems marked as (text), provide answers in prose, algorithms (pseudo-code or code), proofs, or mathematical equations as appropriate.

**Note:** Code solutions should handle any input, not just the examples provided.

## Problems:

1. **Recurrence [10 points]**
   - Solve the recurrence relation T(n) = 3T(n/4) + 4n using repeated substitution and the Master Method.

2. **Master Theorem [20 points]**
   - Apply the Master method to solve several recurrence relations, detailing which case of the theorem applies.

3. **Radix Sort [10 points]**
   - Illustrate the operation of Radix-Sort on a list of strings using lexicographical ordering.

4. **Double Hashing [15 points]**
   - Implement a hash table with double hashing and resolve collisions using a specific secondary hash function.

5. **Radix Sort (Code) [15 points]**
   - Write a Java program to sort an array of strings lexicographically using radix sort.

6. **Word Pattern (Code) [15 points]**
   - Implement a program to determine if a string follows a given pattern with a specified delimiter.

7. **Algorithm Analysis [5 points]**
   - Analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithms developed in problems 4-6 using Big-O notation.

**Extra Credit Problem:**

- **Subarray [5 points]**
  - Develop a method to find a subarray in an unsorted array with a sum equal to a given target, optimizing for time and space complexity.
